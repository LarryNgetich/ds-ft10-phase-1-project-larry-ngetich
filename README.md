# Aircraft Risk Management Analysis

## Overview

The **Aircraft Risk Management Analysis** project aims to evaluate historical aviation accident data to identify aircraft with the lowest risk profiles. This analysis will provide critical insights that will guide our company's decisions as we expand into the aviation sector.

## Objectives

- Analyze civil aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023.
- Identify trends in aviation accidents by aircraft type.
- Determine the aircraft with the lowest incidence of accidents.
- Explore factors that may correlate with higher risks of accidents.

## Importance

As we venture into the aviation industry, understanding safety risks is paramount. Making informed decisions regarding aircraft acquisitions is crucial for operational efficiency and regulatory compliance. This analysis will help us mitigate risks and enhance our strategic decision-making.

## Data Source

The analysis is based on datasets sourced from the **National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)**, which includes records of civil aviation accidents over several decades.

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LarryNgetich/ds-ft10-phase-1-project-larry-ngetich.git
